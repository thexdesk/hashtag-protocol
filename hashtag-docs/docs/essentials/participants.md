For details on project phases, please see [Project Roadmap](/essentials/roadmap)

## Publisher (phase 1,2)

Application or platform that implements Hashtag Protocol. Publishers must be
enabled by Protocol to implement minting and tagging contracts.

    <tr>
      <td width="50%">
        <ul>
          <li>Provide users content tagging stored to a global, immutable database.</li>
          <li>Surface and display tagging data and tagged content from own or third party applications.</li>
          <li>Generate additional revenue for providing tagging to users.</li>
          <li>Increase cross-platform discoverability and engagement with your application/platform/content.</li>

## Creator (phase 1,2)

platform. Publishers may also create <code>HASHTAG</code> tokens on their own platform, which

**Notes:**

A participant may perform several roles at the same time. For example,
participant could create a <code>HASHTAG</code> on their own platform and auction it there.
That would make this participant **_Publisher_**, **_Creator_** &
**_Auctioneer_** and revenue would flow accordingly.

**_Publisher_** and **_Auctioneer_** must be enabled to run the Protocol. Please
contact us at [contact@hashtag-protocol.org](mailto:contact@hashtag-protocol.org) if you would like to enable your
application.
