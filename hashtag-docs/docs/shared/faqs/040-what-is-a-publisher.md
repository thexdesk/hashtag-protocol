## What is a "Publisher"?

A **_Publisher_**, represented in the system by their Ethereum wallet address,
is an application, network or platform implementing the Hashtag Protocol to
provide their customers and/or application content tagging stored to a
decentralized, globally readable database.

In addition, **_Publishers_** are incentivized to use the protocol with generous
[revenue
sharing](https://docs.hashtag-protocol.org/essentials/protocol-overview.html#revenue-sharing)
from both token sales and tagging.

**_Publishers_** must be whitelisted to use the Protocol. Please [contact
us](contact@hashtag-protocol.org) to register your application.
