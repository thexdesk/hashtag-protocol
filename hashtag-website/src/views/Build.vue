                  Hashtag Protocol is an experimental, early stage project
                  focused on helping application developers provide
                  decentralized tagging to their application and earning revenue
                  at the same time.

                  Besides questions, suggestions or critiques, we are especially
                  interested in hearing from those who are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Interested in offering decentralized asset/content tagging
                    functionality in your application.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Interested in setting up one or more independent HASHTAG
                    registration and auction sites (think Go Daddy but for
                    HASHTAG tokens).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Non-fungible token projects or token owners who would like
                    to have their digital assets be taggable on our
                    demonstration dApp.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Any developer interested in our vision and would like to get
                    involved “early on”.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Seed stage/pre-product-market fit VCs who want to disrupt
                    the centralized social networks' stranglehold on the vast
                    social, informational and financial equity of stored in
                    hashtags.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  To earn revenue from Hashtag Protocol your publisher wallet
                  address must be whitelisted in our Protocol contracts.
